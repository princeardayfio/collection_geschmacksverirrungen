HumorCare e.V. Germany - Austria I snippet between blurb and cover from the tribute to René Schweizer. The art of the comic.

René Schweizer became internationally known for his individual humor, tactical madness, his dadaistic and instructive texts, his laughter as well as his ability to live life from the comic side.
He endured being looked at comically when he asked for the fourth best apple variety at the market stall or for the fourth best surgeon before heart surgery.
However, it makes a difference whether one voluntarily puts oneself into the role of a harlequin or whether one is declared to be one by people simply because one likes to joke. There also a Swiss got depressed.

So nine snippets selected for Coding da Vinci tell about the communication between people, with the audience, about stage roles, about countless stories like about the phenomenon Kleinbasel with the art fair, the Art Basel, the customs at the Vogel Gryff-Fest; in the introductory speech to the evening program of the 2nd International Congress "Humor in Therapy" all world views and (primal) stories are included.
The "hidden" person in the harlequin costume is captured on the cover with Schweizer's real face.

From melodrama to tragedy. A harlequin was allowed to open the eyes of the king, to provide him with criticism, as long as it was packaged in a dignified way. His or hers? Sometimes the harlequin did not survive.
In art, there are numerous examples around the harlequin, such as "The Drunkard" (Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Germanisches Nationalmuseum), "Carnival in Rome" (Johannes Lingelbach, Kunsthistorisches Museum Wien Gemäldegalerie), "Harlequin" (2011, Igor Gubskiy, see Wikibrief).

For Schweizer, the turn of the millennium was a chance to get closer to the phenomenon of story as well as nothingness. This brings us to laughter.
